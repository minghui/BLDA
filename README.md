Joint Behavior-Topic Model for Microblogs

We propose an LDA-based behavior-topic model (B-LDA) which jointly models user topic interests and behavioral patterns. We focus the study of the model on on-line social network settings such as microblogs like Twitter where the textual content is relatively short but user inter-actions on them are rich.
